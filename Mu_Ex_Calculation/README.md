# Folder for MuEx calculations

A pre-requisite for GCNCMC calculations is the excess chemical potential (mu_ex) of the molecule being simualated. This can be calculated by performing a basic hydration free energy calculation of your molecule. 

In this folder we have provided a quick way of setting up and calculating these for all the ligands studied in work.
